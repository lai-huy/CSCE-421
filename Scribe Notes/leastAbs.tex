\section{Least Absolutes}
The residual sum of absolutes, or $RSA$, is defined as
\[
RSA=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left|y_1\hat{\beta}_0-\hat{\beta}_1X_{1,N}\right|
\]

\subsection{Advantages over Least Squares}
When an error is over $1$, squaring it will cause the error to increase. Additionally, when outliers exist, least squares becomes more susceptible to them and potentially overfits the model.

As an example, of how least squares can overfit to outliers is displayed in the figure\footnote{Image source \href{https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ComparingLeastSquaresFitAndLeastAbsoluteDeviationsFit/}{here}} below.
