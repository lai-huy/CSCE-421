\section{Introduction}

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to establish a relationship between two or more variables. Linear regression is a simple yet powerful method used to predict a dependent variable's value based on the values of one or more independent variables. As its name implies, linear regression models can analyze the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely used in various fields, including finance, economics, social sciences, and engineering, to make predictions and inform decision-making processes. Linear regression analysis provides valuable insights into the underlying data and can help identify trends, patterns, and outliers.
